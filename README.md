## "Ey Big Girl, Make em' Back It Up" - V.I.C.

This application requires a mySql databse to be created, along with the "npm run seed" command before starting up the server. This project was definitely more tedious because of all the connections each data set had with them. Also a lot of debugging was necessary before all the typos were shored-up
